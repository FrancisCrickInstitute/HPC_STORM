# HPC_STORM
Scripts for running ThunderSTORM at the Francis Crick Institute's CAMP HPC

This is an ongoing re-write / refactor for running Imperial College's ThunderSTORM software on the Francis Crick's HPC infrastructure (CAMP).

NOTE: Most existing scripts & documentation will be invalid / out of date.
